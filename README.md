# tictactoe
first game, of course it has to be tictactoe.<br />
This actually took me a long time to get perfect enough to want to post. I made this on linux, and then finished it on VScode on macOS.<br />
If you want to run this game on windows, you will need to change the way it clears the screen.
```
system("clear") = MAC
system("cls") = WINDOWS
```

<br /> in this first section I have made it so you can choose which player goes first, player 1 is automatially set to 'X' and player 2 is automaticaly set to 'O'. You can also choose to play against a human (your friend) or if you are like me and your girlfriend is sick of playing your bad terminal games, you can choose to play against a really bad "AI", it has actually beaten me before, so I really don't know what that says about me. <br />

<br />Here you can see some more really badly cropped photos of what the game looks like while playing, each of the numbers represents a spot in the array (obviously), when you want to choose a spot you just enter the number you would like to put your character in. If you win it says yay you won, if you lost to the AI it makes you cry.
It also shows a message for a no-win game called a cat game. <br />
You cant change a players choice, so if there is already an X in number 1 you cant override that with an O, and vice versa, it will make you take the turn indefinitely, you can try as hard as you like.
